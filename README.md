# WebTreeVisualizer
Instruction tool to help visualize binary tree data structures:

In the CSSE230 Data Structures and Algorithm Ananlysis course at Rose-Hulman, we implement several different tree data structures. This project's goal is to develop a web based visualizer to help students understand how the tree structures work.

I will attempt to implement a Red-Black Tree visualizer first
